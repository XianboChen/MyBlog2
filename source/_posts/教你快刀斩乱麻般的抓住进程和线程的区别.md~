相信大家学习操作系统时都书上看到了密密麻麻写的几张纸的进程与线程的关系的分析，但是初学者看完之后往往会感觉很乱，抓不住主要矛盾，这里就教你一针见血的指出进程（preocess)与线程(thread)的区别。
</br>
首先谷歌一下，看看国外的大牛都是怎么说的：

哈哈，看来大家都对这个问题很有兴趣啊，有很多的讨论帖子，这里选取两个贴上：

> Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution. The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.

> Erlang uses the term "process" because it does not expose a shared-memory multiprogramming model. Calling them "threads" would imply that they have shared memory.

> Processes vs Threads

> A process is an executing instance of an application. What does that mean? Well, for example, when you double-click the Microsoft Word icon, you start a process that runs Word. A thread is a path of execution within a process. Also, a process can contain multiple threads. When you start Word, the operating system creates a process and begins executing the primary thread of that process.

> It’s important to note that a thread can do anything a process can do. But since a process can consist of multiple threads, a thread could be considered a ‘lightweight’ process. Thus, the essential difference between a thread and a process is the work that each one is used to accomplish. Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more ‘heavyweight’ tasks – basically the execution of applications.

> Another difference between a thread and a process is that threads within the same process share the same address space, whereas different processes do not. This allows threads to read from and write to the same data structures and variables, and also facilitates communication between threads. Communication between processes – also known as IPC, or inter-process communication – is quite difficult and resource-intensive.

> Here is the analogy I use in Linux Kernel Development. Processes are the abstraction of running programs: A binary image, virtualized memory, various kernel resources, an associated security context, and so on. Threads are the unit of execution in a process: A virtualized processor, a stack, and program state. Put another way, processes are running binaries and threads are the smallest unit of execution schedulable by an operating system's process scheduler.

好了，看到这里我觉得如果要我一针见血的指出进程与线程的区别，我觉得可以这么说：
**线程是一种在同一进程中可以共享资源的轻量级（lightweight）进程**

当然这是一种很浅白的说法，关于进程与线程的理解还有很多，大家可以自行google。不过我觉得对于一种模糊的概念应该首先快刀斩乱麻般的找到他们的痛点，那么接下来的研究就简单多了。

这篇博客也对进程与线程做了形象的描述，大家也可以参考看下：

下面这段话很好的说明了线程存在的意义：
> What's the point? We obviously need processes. But why introduce the separate concept of a thread and allow multithreaded processes? There are four primary benefits to multithreading:

>**Programming  abstraction**. Dividing up work and assigning each division to a unit of execution (a thread) is a natural approach to many problems. Programming patterns that utilize this approach include the reactor, thread-per-connection, and thread pool patterns. Some, however, view threads as an anti-pattern. The inimitable Alan Cox summed this up well with the quote, "threads are for people who can't program state machines."
**Parallelism**. In machines with multiple processors, threads provide an efficient way to achieve true parallelism. As each thread receives its own virtualized processor and is an independently-schedulable entity, multiple threads may run on multiple processors at the same time, improving a system's throughput. To the extent that threads are used to achieve parallelism—that is, there are no more threads than processors—the "threads are for people who can't program state machines" quote does not apply.
**Blocking I/O**. Without threads, blocking I/O halts the whole process. This can be detrimental to both throughput and latency. In a multithreaded process, individual threads may block, waiting on I/O, while other threads make forward progress. Asynchronous & non-blocking I/O are alternative solutions to threads for this issue.
**Memory savings**. Threads provide an efficient way to share memory yet utilize multiple units of execution. In this manner they are an alternative to multiple processes.
